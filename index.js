//Write a function called superbowlWin() in index.js:

//The function should receive 1 argument, an Array of JavaScript Objects
//Each object has two properties: year and result
//It should use find() to test each Object to see if the result is "W" â€” a win!
//It should return the year when the win occurred (if it occurred at all!)
//If no win is found, it should return, sadly, undefined

//function superbowlWin(recordsArray) {
//    let winningYear = recordsArray.find(recordObj => recordObj.result === 'W')
 //       retun winningYear



//if(winningYear obj is found.  Then return winningYear.year)
//else if not found return undefined.

function superbowlWin(recordArray){
    const matchedItem = recordArray.find(function (list){
        return list.result === 'W'
    })  
    if(matchedItem){
        return matchedItem.year
    } else{
        return matchedItem
    }
}
